+ To check contrast there is a handy online tool at:
  - www.snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html

+ You do not need lots of computers to test your site, as there are online tools to show you what a page looks like in multiple browsers:
  - BrowserCam.com
  - BrowserLab.Adobe.com 
  - BrowserShots.org
  - CrossBrowserTesting.com

+ If you come across a CSS bug, you can use your favorite search engine to try and find a solution. Or you can check these sites:
  - PositionIsEverything.net
  - QuirksMode.org

+ Free open source fonts that we can use freely. These are the websites:
  - www.fontsquirrel.com
  - www.fontex.com
  - www.openfontlibrary.com

***NOTE**: It is better to check the lisence agreements of the fonts. Distrubuterd may have determine their own usage conditions. Google also provides open source fonts (www.google.com/webfonts).*
***NOTE**: Look at these formats; eot, woff, ttf/otf, svg*

+ https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html
  - ISO 639-1 language codes used to define an HTML page language. There are more ISO 639 versions other than 639-1.

+ **[https://whatwg.org/](https://whatwg.org/)**
  - WHATWG: Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group is a community that interest in improving HTML through various standards and tests.

+ **[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html)**
  - The list of few HTML character entities.

+ SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language)
+ DTD (Document Type Definition)
+ (For HTML5) An IETF BCP 47 language tag is a standardized code or tag that is used to identify human languages in the Internet.
+ (For HTML4) RFC 1766: Tags for the identification of languages.

+ **[http://microformats.org/](http://microformats.org/)**: Microformats are set of conventions or patterns used in HTML to mark up data with semantic meaning. They are a way to add structured information to HTML content, making it more machine-readable and understandable.

+ Schema.org and JSON-LD does the same job as Microformats do but in more powerful way.
  - Schema.org is a collaborative initiative by major search engines, including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Yandex, aimed at creating a structured data markup schema that webmasters can use to provide more context and meaning to the content on their websites. The goal is to help search engines better understand the content of web pages, leading to more relevant and rich search results.

+ FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
+ URL Encoding
+ Enumerated Attribute
  - In HTML, an enumerated attribute is an attribute that can only take a specific set of predefined values. These values are limited to a fixed list of options, and the attribute can only accept one of those options.

+ **Markdown Language**: It is a lightweight markup language. Markdown is often used to create README files, blog posts, and documentation.
+ Descendant Combinator, Child Combinator
+ There are standardized and non-standardized attributes in HTML. Non-standardized attributes are often introduced by individual browsers or applications.
+ `data-*` attribute helps us to create and store our own values. For example these attributes might be read by JavaScript and take action.
+ **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: TCP is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation by which applications can exchange data.
+ TLS (Transport Layer Security)
  - It is a security protocol.
  - TLS Handshake
    + The TLS handshake is an introduction. It indicates safe communication between two servers where messages are exchanged to acknowledge each other, verify each other, set up cryptographic codes, and agree on session keys.

+ **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: CORS is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. An example of a cross-origin request: the front-end JavaScript code served from `https://domain-a.com` uses XMLHttpRequest to make a request for `https://domain-b.com/data.json`.
+ **Feed**: Feeds are small text files that provide information about content on websites. When content is updated, the feed text file is also updated, either manually or programatically. Applications called "readers" or "aggregators" can then check these small text files and notify someone when new content is available. There are RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed and Atom feed. The difference between the two formats is the XML tags that are used.
+ **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)**: Develops open standards through transparent processes with one goal in mind: to make the Internet work better.
+ **CSP (Content Security Policy)**: It is a security feature implemented by web browsers to mitigate the risks associated with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks. It allows website owners to specify which sources of content, such as scripts, styles, and images, are considered trusted and can be executed or loaded by a web page.
+ **Cryptographic Nonce**: A cryptographic nonce, often simply referred to as a "nonce", is a random or pseudo-random number generated for use in cryptographic protocols and systems. The term "nonce" stands for "number used once".
+ **[https://caniuse.com/](https://caniuse.com/)**: By checking tags from this website, you can check the browser compatibility of them.
+ **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**: Set of attributes you can add to HTML elements that define ways to make web content and applications accessible to users with disabilities who use assistive technologies (AT).
+ **html.spec.whatwg.org**: This website is the official website for new HTML specifications.
+ **MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)**: It is a standard that defines how different types of data are encoded and transmitted over the internet.
+ Defense in depth strategy.
+ Data URL
  - It is a way to embed data, typically in the form of a file or resource, directly into an HTML or CSS document.
  - **MIME-type**: This specifies the type of data being included.

+ **Open Graph**: Open Graph is a set of protocols that allows you to provide structured metadata in your HTML to control how your content appears when shared on social media platforms, not just Facebook. While Facebook initiated the Open Graph protocol, other platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and others also support it. Open Graph meta tags help define elements such as the title, description, image, and other information about your web page. So, Open Graph is not limited to Facebook; it's a broader standard for social media sharing.
+ **Facebook Instant Articles**: Facebook Instant Articles is a specific feature designed by Facebook for faster and more engaging content consumption directly within the Facebook platform. It's optimized for mobile devices and provides a seamless reading experience. However, it is specific to Facebook and doesn't extend to other social media platforms.
+ Twitter Cards
+ Semantic and non-semantic elements categorized based on the meaning or role they convey to both browsers and developers.
  - Semantic elements examples include `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, and others.
  - Non-semantic elements examples include `<div>`, `<span>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<font>`, and others.

+ **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**: Set of international standards and guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure that websites, web applications, and digital content are accessible to people with disabilities.
