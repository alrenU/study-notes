# Kubernetes
# Unordered Notes
- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: It is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Install Tools
- **`kubectl`**: The Kubernetes command-line tool, `kubectl`, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use `kubectl` to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs. Can be used with any Kubernetes cluster, whether local or remote.
- **`kind`**: Tool to run Kubernetes clusters locally using Docker or Podman containers. Creates lightweight Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers for testing and development. Ideal for CI/CD pipelines or local development with multiple clusters or isolated environments.
- **`minikube`**: Tool to run a single-node or multi-node Kubernetes cluster locally on your computer. Provides a complete, single-node Kubernetes cluster in a VM or container on your local machine. Best for development and testing; provides a more "full-featured" local Kubernetes environment compared to kind.
- **`kubeadm`**: Tool to initialize and manage Kubernetes clusters. Helps set up Kubernetes clusters, from creating the *control plane* and *worker nodes* to joining them into a cluster. Suitable for both local and production environments.

- **Cluster**: A set of nodes that work together to run containerized applications. It's components:
  - **Nodes**: A node is a physical or virtual machine within a Kubernetes cluster. Nodes are of two main types:
    1. **Master Node (Control Plane Node)**: Manages the clusterâ€™s overall health and operation, ensuring configurations are met. It's components:
      - **API Server**: Handles API requests and communication between components and users.
      - **Controller Manager**: Monitors cluster state and makes adjustments to maintain the desired state.
      - **Scheduler**: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability and requirements.
      - **etcd**: A distributed key-value store for cluster data and state information.

    2. **Worker Node (Compute Node)**: Runs applications and workloads (pods). It's components:
      - **Kubelet**: Ensures containers are running in pods as specified by the control plane.
      - **Kube Proxy**: Manages network routing and load balancing within the cluster.
      - **Container Runtime**: Software that executes and manages containerized applications (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O).

  - **Kubernetes Objects**: These components are deployed on worker nodes. Master nodes do not run application workloads directly but manage the scheduling and orchestration of these components across the worker nodes.
    - **Pods**: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.
    - **Services**: Facilitate communication between pods and with the external world, providing load balancing and stable endpoints.
    - **Deployments**: Manage the deployment and scaling of a set of pods. They ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running and handle rolling updates.
    - **ReplicaSets**: Ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. Deployments typically manage ReplicaSets.
    - **Other Controllers**: Oversees application deployment and scaling, including StatefulSets, DaemonSets, and Jobs.

- **Load Balancing**: Refers to distributing network or application traffic across multiple instances of a service to ensure that no single instance becomes a bottleneck.Main aspects of load balancing in Kubernetes:
  - **Algorithms**: Kubernetes typically uses round-robin by default, but can be configured for other methods.
  - **Scaling**: Works in conjunction with *Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)* to adjust the number of pods based on load.

  - **Types**
    - **Cluster IP**: Provide internal load balancing within the Kubernetes cluster by distributing traffic among pods that match the service's selector.
    - **NodePort**: Services expose a service on a static port on each node's IP address, allowing external traffic to be routed to the service while still balancing the load across pods.
    - **LoadBalancer**: Available in cloud environments, provision an external load balancer managed by the cloud provider to distribute incoming traffic to the service. (like AWS ELB or Google Cloud Load Balancer).

- **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**: A standard interface for Kubernetes to manage containers through various runtimes (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O) without being tied to any specific one.
  - **Abstraction Layer**: CRI abstracts Kubernetes from the specifics of different container runtimes, allowing it to use multiple runtimes via a unified interface.
  - **CRI Components**
    - **RuntimeService**: Handles container lifecycle operations like creating, starting, stopping, and deleting containers.
    - **ImageService**: Manages container images, including pulling images from a registry, listing images, and removing images.

## Concepts
### Overview
- **What Kubernetes Offers**
  - In production, managing containers and avoiding downtime is crucial. Kubernetes offers a resilient framework for running distributed systems, handling scaling, failover, and deployment patterns effectively.

  - Kubernetes provides you:
    - **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Exposes containers via DNS or IP. Balances traffic and maintains stability.
    - **Storage Orchestration**: Automatically mounts storage systems (local, cloud, etc.).
    - **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**: Controls updates by managing container creation and removal.
    - **Automatic Bin Packing**: Optimizes resource use by scheduling containers based on CPU and memory needs.
    - **Self-Healing**: Restarts and replaces failing containers; ensures containers are ready before advertising.
    - **Secret and Configuration Management**: Securely manages sensitive data and configuration without rebuilding images.
    - **Batch Eexecution**: Manages batch and CI workloads, including automatic container replacement.
    - **Horizontal Scaling**: Scales applications up/down via command, UI, or automatically based on CPU usage.
    - **IPv4/IPv6 Dual-Stack**: Supports allocation of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services.
    - **Extensible**: Allows feature additions without altering upstream code.

### Objects In Kubernetes
- **Kubernetes Objects**
  - Represent the state of your cluster and include details such as:
    - What containerized applications are running and on which nodes.
    - Available resources for those applications.
    - Policies for application behavior, including restart, upgrades, and fault tolerance.

  - Creating an object sets the desired state for your cluster, and Kubernetes works to maintain that state.
  - Use the Kubernetes API to create, modify, or delete objects. Tools like `kubectl` make API calls for you, but you can also use Client Libraries to interact with the API directly in your own programs.

- **Object Spec and Status**
  - **Object Spec**
    - Defines the desired state of the object when created.
    - Describes the configuration and characteristics you want for the resource.

  - **Object Status**
    - Shows the current state of the object.
    - Updated by the Kubernetes system to reflect the actual state.

  - **How They Work**: Kubernetes actively manages the object's status to match the desired state defined in the spec. For example for a deployment with a spec of three replicas, Kubernetes will start three instances. If one fails, Kubernetes updates the status and starts a replacement to match the spec.

- **Describing a Kubernetes Object**
  - To create a Kubernetes object, define its desired state and basic info in a YAML file called a *manifest*. Use the Kubernetes API or `kubectl` to create the object. `kubectl` converts the YAML manifest to JSON for the API request. JSON is also supported, but YAML is the usual format.

  - To create a Deployment using a manifest file, use the `kubectl apply` command.
    - **Example**: `kubectl apply -f file-name.yaml`

- **Required Fields**
  - In the Kubernetes manifest (YAML or JSON), you must include:
    - **`apiVersion`**: Specifies the Kubernetes API version used.
    - **`kind`**: Indicates the type of object to create.
    - **`metadata`**: Provides unique identifiers for the object, including a name, UID, and optional namespace.
    - **`spec`**: Defines the desired state of the object. The format varies by object type.

- **Server-Side Field Validation**
  - Detects unrecognized or duplicate fields in an object, similar to `kubectl --validate` but on the server side.

  - **Validation Levels**
    1. **Strict**: Errors if validation fails.
    2. **Warn**: Validation errors show as warnings, not failures.
    3. **Ignore**: No field validation is performed.

  - **`kubectl` Validation Flag**
    - **`--validate=true`** (default) is equivalent to strict.
    - **`--validate=false`** is equivalent to ignore.

  - If `kubectl` cannot connect to an API server with field validation, it uses client-side validation.

#### Kubernetes Object Management
- **Management Techniques**
  - In Kubernetes, `kubectl` commands can be categorized into three types based on how they manage resources and configurations.

  1. **Imperative Commands**: Executed directly on the live state of the Kubernetes cluster for immediate changes (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting resources).
    - **Management Technique**: Operates on live objects.
    - **Recommended Environment**: Development projects.

  2. **Imperative Object Configuration**: Manages resources using individual configuration files with imperative commands to apply changes.
    - **Management Technique**: Operates on individual files.
    - **Recommended Environment**: Production projects.

  3. **Declarative Object Configuration**: Manages resources through directories of configuration files, where Kubernetes maintains the desired state.
    - **Management Technique**: Operates on directories of files.
    - **Recommended Environment**: Production projects.

> ***NOTE**: A Kubernetes object should be managed using only one technique. Mixing and matching techniques for the same object results in undefined behavior.*
